    "Fine-tuning Transformers, specifically BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), refers to the process of training a pretrained BERT model on a specific downstream task. BERT is an encoder-only language model that has been pretrained on a large corpus of text to learn contextual representations of words.\n",
    "\n",

    "This process is important because it allows you to leverage the knowledge and language understanding captured by BERT and apply it to different tasks. By fine-tuning BERT, you can benefit from its contextual understanding of language and transfer that knowledge to specific domain-specific or task-specific problems. Fine-tuning enables BERT to learn from a smaller labeled dataset and generalize well to unseen examples, making it a powerful tool for various natural language processing tasks. It helps to bridge the gap between pretraining on a large corpus and the specific requirements of downstream applications, ultimately improving the performance and effectiveness of models in various real-world scenarios.\n"

The model is switched to training mode, which is necessary for certain model behaviors like dropout to work correctly during training. The function processes the data in batches for each epoch, which involves several steps for each batch: transferring the data to the correct device (like a GPU), running the data through the model to get outputs and calculate loss, updating the model's parameters using the calculated gradients, adjusting the learning rate, and clearing the old gradients. These steps are repeated for each batch of data, and the progress bar is updated accordingly to reflect the progress. Once all epochs are completed, the trained model is saved to be used later.\n",
